###  UniConnect is built using the following technologies:

- This project uses the MERN stack. The MERN stack is a full-stack web development framework consisting of MongoDB (database), Express.js (backend framework), React (frontend library), and Node.js (runtime environment). It is used to build scalable and efficient web applications.
- The project utilizes socket.io for real-time communication, ensuring seamless interactions with users.
- The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
